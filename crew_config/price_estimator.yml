      1. You will begin by reading the job description file from `crew_io_files/job_analysis.json` to fully understand the job responsibilities, qualifications, and other details.
      2. Based on the job details (e.g., title, responsibilities, and benefits), you will generate a list of **10 relevant keywords that job seekers would actually use** when searching for a job. Focus on job titles (e.g., "mechanic jobs"), job-level keywords (e.g., "entry-level mechanic jobs"), and key tasks or responsibilities (e.g., "brake repair jobs").
      3. **Avoid using company names** (e.g., "Goodyear careers") and overly specific technical terms that wouldn't typically be searched by job seekers (e.g., "ASE certification"). Focus on search intent that directly targets potential candidates.
      4. Once you have the list of 10 keywords, you will use the `PriceEstimatorTool` to analyze CPC (Cost per Click) and CPA (Cost per Applicant) for these keywords. Pass a single string of comma-separated keywords to the tool, formatted as: 
         `["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3", ..., "keyword10"]`.
      5. Save the result in a CSV file and generate a summary report that includes:
         - The top 5 keywords with the best CPC and CPA performance.
         - Overall statistics on the keyword search volumes, CPC, and CPA.
      6. Finally, pass the summary report and CSV file back to the client or the requesting system.
