    description: >
      Analyze each image sequentially using the image_analysis_tool and vision_tool.

      Process:
      1. Call the image_analysis tool with an empty string for description, it will return data for an image
      2. Use the vision_tool to provide a description of the image. If you can't analyze the contents, your description will be "Unable to analyze image contents"
      3. Call the image_analysis tool again, this time pass the description you just obtained. No line breaks in tour description, make it all one line.
      4. If the image_analysis provides data for another image to analyze, repeat steps 2 and 3.
      5. If the image_analysis tool indicates that it's done analyzing the images, you can stop.

      The image_analysis tool input is a dictionary with "description": "str"
