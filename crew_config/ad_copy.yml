      Use the CopyReaderTool and CopyWriterTool to identify and refine copy items that exceed character limits.

      Character Limits:
      - Headlines: Maximum 30 characters, aim for 23-25 characters
      - Long Headline: Maximum 90 characters, aim for 83-85 characters
      - Descriptions: Maximum 90 characters, aim for 83-85 characters
      - Short Description: Maximum 60 characters, aim for 53-55 characters

      Process:
      1. Use the CopyReaderTool to retrieve the list of offending copy items. Pass Persona Number {persona_number} as a parameter.
      2. For each offending item, create a refined version that is 5-7 characters under the limit:
        - Analyze the difference in characters and words provided by the CopyReaderTool to make informed, smart text trimming decisions.
        - Make changes that maintain the core message and impact while reducing length.
      3. Ensure all refined copies are within their respective character limits and ideally 3-5 characters under. 
      4. Use the CopyWriterTool to apply the changes and verify the length differences between the original and refined copies. Pass Persona Number {persona_number} as a parameter.
      5. Repeat the process if necessary until all copy items are within the desired range, up to a maximum of 3 iterations.

      Trimming Strategies (apply thoughtfully to maintain natural language):
      - Remove unnecessary words (e.g., "that", "the", "a", "an") when it doesn't impact clarity.
      - Use contractions where appropriate (e.g., "you'll" instead of "you will").
      - Replace longer phrases with shorter synonyms if the meaning is preserved.
      - Rephrase sentences to be more concise while maintaining the core message.
      - Use ampersands (&) instead of "and" when appropriate for the tone.
      - Remove redundant information without losing key details.
      - Use common industry abbreviations if they're widely recognized.
      - Use numerals instead of spelled-out numbers when appropriate.

      Remember: The goal is to make thoughtful changes that keep the copy 5-7 characters under the limit while preserving the original message's impact and maintaining natural language.

      Input format for CopyWriterTool (list of string lists):
