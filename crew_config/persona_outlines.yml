    goal: >
      Create richly detailed, multi-dimensional personas that authentically represent potential 
      candidates for any given job opening across various industries, and match them with 
      appropriate avatar images. These personas should be so vivid and insightful that they 
      could drive highly targeted recruitment strategies, inform product development, and 
      shape company policies. Aim to uncover hidden motivations, challenges, and aspirations 
      that go beyond surface-level demographics, tailoring each persona to the specific job 
      and company context provided.

      Create FIVE distinct persona outlines based on the information in the input files given,
      and match each persona with an appropriate avatar image:

      Input files:
      - crew_io_files/brand_voice.json
      - crew_io_files/competitor_analysis.json
      - crew_io_files/job_analysis.json
      - crew_io_files/employee_sentiment.json

      Steps:
      1. Analyze the input json files provided thoroughly, considering:
         - Brand Voice: Align with company values and communication.
         - Candidate Demographics: Inform targeting and characteristics.
         - Competitor Analysis: Differentiate positioning and value propositions.
         - Job Analysis: Reflect key requirements and responsibilities.
         - Employee Sentiment: Create authentic, relatable personas.
      2. For each persona outline, include:
         - Persona Number: Numeric identifier (1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
         - Persona Name: Descriptive title capturing key traits (e.g., "Empathetic Problem Solver").
         - Description: Comprehensive overview of characteristics, behaviors, and motivations.
      3. Ensure each outline is distinct and captures a unique candidate archetype.
      4. Use the data as a foundation, but feel free to expand with plausible inferences.
      5. After creating the persona outlines, use the AvatarFinderTool to retrieve a list of potential avatar images and their metadata.
      6. Analyze each image's metadata and compare it with the created persona descriptions.
      7. Identify the single most appropriate image for every persona, making sure each image is only used once.
      8. Adhere to the following demographic representation rules for the 5 personas:
         - 2 white (1 male, 1 female)
         - 1 hispanic (random gender)
         - 1 african american (random gender)
         - 1 asian (random gender)
      9. Add the selected "Persona Avatar ID" (the image Task ID) to each persona outline.
      10. Format the final output as a JSON object with an array of 5 comprehensive persona outline objects.

      *** CRITICAL: ABSOLUTELY ZERO INFORMATION FROM THE AVATAR IMAGES TOOL MUST BE ADDED TO THE DESCRIPTION.
      THE DESCRIPTION MUST BE PURELY BASED ON THE INFORMATION FROM THE INPUT JSON FILES.
      ALSO DON'T USE GENDER AND ETHNICITY INFORMATION FROM THE CANDIDATE DEMOGRAPHICS TASK. ***
